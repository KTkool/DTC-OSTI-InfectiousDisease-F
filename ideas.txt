extending current treatment models:
-make treatment efficiency timedependent to accomodate viral adaptation through mutation
--stochastic
--deterministic
-different treatment patterns
--alternating treatments
--all drugs at the same time
-adding more treatments
--other drugs currently in development or in use
--vaccination
